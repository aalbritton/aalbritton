## Hi!
Pronouns: she/her

Fun fact: My favorite song of all time is Everybody Wants to Rule the World by Tears For Fears. 

I'm currently working on an independent project in R regarding the books I read and how I rate them. The main question I am asking is, "Can I predict a poorly rated book or a DNF?" This comes from my experience with BookTok, a subdivision on TikTok dedicated to (you guessed it) books. I have noticed that these popular recommendations do not tend to be up to my standards of a "good" book, so I want to see if I could break down the characteristics that constitute a "good" book versus a "bad" one.
